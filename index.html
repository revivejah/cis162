<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is jacob jimenez, I am a student at Cerritos College. my main focus at the school is to take this class and become a better html/css coder. I have no real experience in coding but making websites can help me help others with their businesses. In all honesty, I wanna get a good job one day that can provide me with good money and family time. I think it's also a plus because depending on the company I could live remotely anywhere.</p>
<h1>When i have free time </h1>
<ol>
    <li> I like to go on walks with friends, family, or loved ones</li>
    <li> I like to go to stores and just look around (clothes, collectibles, antique stuff. anything)</li>
    <li> I love to watch movies a lot, especially with my girlfriend. (we ramble a lot about what we think of the movie.)</li>


</ol>

    <p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Visit Youtube.com</a> because there are a lot of intresting videos to learn from.</p>
